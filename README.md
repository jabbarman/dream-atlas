# Dream Atlas

Team-operated product delivery workspace for taking the concept from **Discovery → POC → MVP** with clear governance, role ownership, and quality gates.

## Operating model

- Specialized role leads (PM, Product, Design, Tech, Dev, QA)
- Shared artifact-first workflow (docs are the source of truth)
- Stage gates at the end of each phase
- Token-budget guardrail with safe-point pauses and WhatsApp alerting protocol

Start here:

1. `docs/ops/TEAM-CHARTER.md`
2. `docs/ops/AGENT-TOPOLOGY.md`
3. `docs/ops/WORKFLOW.md`
4. `docs/ops/TOKEN-GUARD.md`
5. `docs/status/PROJECT-STATE.yaml`

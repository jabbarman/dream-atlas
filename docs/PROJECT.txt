Dream Atlas – A Procedural Memory Map.
1. Problem + Target User
Problem
People capture fragments of dreams, memories, and ideas, but they remain:
Linear (notes apps, journals)
Hard to revisit spatially or relationally
Lacking any sense of “emotional geography” or emergent structure
Creative and reflective material is under-explored because it isn’t navigable or discoverable in an intuitive way.
Target Users
Primary:
Creatives: writers, artists, game designers, filmmakers
Reflective users: journalers, therapists-in-training, people into memory/dream logging
Secondary:
Researchers / educators exploring narrative, memory, or qualitative data
Curious tech users interested in generative/procedural systems
2. Value Proposition / Business Goal
Value Proposition
Turn abstract, emotional, and fragmentary text into a living, explorable atlas.
Users don’t just store memories—they navigate them.
Discover patterns, clusters, and constellations of meaning over time.
A new medium between journaling, mind-mapping, and generative art.
Business / Project Goal
Short term: Build a compelling, differentiated interactive prototype that demonstrates:
Procedural world-building from personal data
Novel UX for memory/narrative exploration
Medium term: Position as:
A creative tool
Or a research/therapy-adjacent exploratory interface
Or a platform concept for “personal knowledge worlds”
3. Success Metrics (30 / 60 / 90 Days)
30 Days (Foundation)
Tech:
User can input text fragments
System generates a navigable 2D atlas (nodes/regions)
Basic procedural layout works
UX:
Pan/zoom/map navigation
Click node → see memory
Metrics:
1–2 internal users can create and explore an atlas
Atlas generation time < X seconds
No critical crashes in basic flows
60 Days (Meaningful Use)
Tech:
Clustering / grouping (themes, proximity, tags, embeddings)
Save/load multiple atlases
Visual differentiation (regions, constellations, landmarks)
UX:
Search or highlight related memories
Basic filtering (time, theme, intensity, etc.)
Metrics:
Users spend >10 minutes per session exploring
At least 3 distinct “map patterns” emerge from real data
Users report discovering connections they hadn’t noticed
90 Days (Compelling Prototype)
Tech:
More advanced procedural generation (terrain, biomes, or layered maps)
Import/export data
Optional AI-assisted clustering or labeling
UX:
“Guided tour” or “memory path” mode
Shareable screenshots or map views
Metrics:
Repeat usage by test users
Clear qualitative feedback: “this changes how I see my notes/memories”
Demo-ready for showcasing or pitching
4. Scope Boundaries (In / Out)
In Scope (v1)
Web app (React + canvas/WebGL/Phaser)
Text input → procedural spatial layout
2D map navigation (pan/zoom)
Nodes = memories/fragments
Basic clustering / grouping logic
Local or simple backend storage
Visual metaphors: nodes, regions, constellations
Out of Scope (v1)
Mobile native apps
Real-time multi-user collaboration
Heavy social features
Full psychotherapy tooling or clinical claims
3D worlds (tempting, but scope risk)
Complex AI interpretation of psychology/meaning (keep it light)
5. Constraints (Time / Budget / Tech / Compliance)
Time
Likely a part-time / spare-time project
Target: meaningful prototype in ~8–12 weeks
Budget
Ideally minimal
Mostly dev time + hosting
Optional: small spend on AI APIs or embeddings
Tech
Frontend: React + Canvas/WebGL/Phaser/Three.js (pick one)
Backend: Simple API (Node/Python) + DB (Postgres/SQLite/Neo4j optional)
Data: Start simple (text + metadata), grow later
Compliance / Ethics
User data is personal and sensitive
Need:
Clear data ownership
Local-first or private-by-default storage
No implicit “mental health” claims
Avoid positioning as therapy or diagnosis tool
6. Top Assumptions / Risks
Assumptions
Users will find spatial metaphors more insightful than lists
Procedural layouts can feel meaningful, not arbitrary
Visual exploration will trigger reflection and discovery
You can get “good enough” structure without heavy AI
Risks
UX risk: Map feels pretty but meaningless
Complexity risk: Procedural generation becomes a time sink
Scope creep: Temptation to add 3D, social, heavy AI too early
Emotional risk: Users may project therapeutic value onto a non-clinical tool
Data modeling risk: Hard to evolve schema once people have real data
Mitigations
Start with very simple, legible rules
Test early with real text
Keep metaphors consistent and explainable
Be explicit about the exploratory/creative nature of the tool
7. Key Stakeholders + Decision Owner
Stakeholders
Me (product vision, domain framing, final direction)
Agentic dev team:
Frontend/procedural systems
Backend/data modeling
UX/interaction design
Test users:
Creatives / writers / reflective users
Possibly educators or researchers later
Decision Owner
Me = Product Owner / Creative Director
Final say on:
Scope cuts
Metaphor and tone
What “good enough” means for v1
Whether it’s a tool, artwork, platform, or research prototype

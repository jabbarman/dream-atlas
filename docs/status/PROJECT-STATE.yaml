resolved_major_problems:
- API timing precision upgraded to high-resolution perf metrics in generate/save/load flows.
- Lightweight render telemetry (current/avg FPS + p95 frame ms) added to POC run summary.
- Telemetry export from POC controls enables persisted JSON evidence for sign-off walkthroughs.
- POC gate approvals and final pass decision are now recorded.
- MVP Slice 1 API persistence hardening delivered (SQLite storage + atlas listing endpoint).
- MVP Slice 1 frontend atlas picker is wired to the listing API.
- MVP Slice 1 QA evidence pass completed and recorded.
next_step: Start MVP Slice 2 user-data ingestion (manual fragment entry + JSON
  paste/import flow).

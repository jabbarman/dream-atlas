  work_signal_reason: Telemetry export is now integrated in the POC UI, so sign-off
    evidence can be captured directly during walkthrough.

resolved_major_problems:
- API timing precision upgraded to high-resolution perf metrics in generate/save/load flows.
- Lightweight render telemetry (current/avg FPS + p95 frame ms) added to POC run summary.
- Telemetry export from POC controls enables persisted JSON evidence for sign-off walkthroughs.
next_step: Run sign-off review (PM/Tech Lead/QA), export telemetry evidence during
  walkthrough, and complete `docs/02-poc/15-SPIKE-1-SIGNOFF-RECORD.md`.

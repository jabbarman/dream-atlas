resolved_major_problems:
- API timing precision upgraded to high-resolution perf metrics in generate/save/load flows.
- Lightweight render telemetry (current/avg FPS + p95 frame ms) added to POC run summary.
- Telemetry export from POC controls enables persisted JSON evidence for sign-off walkthroughs.
next_step: Collect PM + Tech Lead + QA approval entries in
  `docs/02-poc/15-SPIKE-1-SIGNOFF-RECORD.md` and record final gate decision.

  work_signal: strong
  work_signal_reason: Live frontend FPS/frame telemetry is now available in the POC
    run summary; gate closure still depends on explicit PM/Tech Lead/QA approvals.

resolved_major_problems:
- API timing precision upgraded to high-resolution perf metrics in generate/save/load flows.
- Lightweight render telemetry (current/avg FPS + p95 frame ms) added to POC run summary.
next_step: Run sign-off review (PM/Tech Lead/QA) and complete
  `docs/02-poc/15-SPIKE-1-SIGNOFF-RECORD.md`; then decide whether telemetry export
  automation should be pulled into MVP scope.

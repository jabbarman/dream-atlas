- [x] Confirm Tier 30 / Tier 60 / Tier 90 headings are clear and acceptable
- [x] Confirm discovery docs remain consistent with existing phase-gate criteria

Status: Completed and accepted by Product Owner (2026-02-19).

## 2026-02-20 — Auto-resume (generic token-guard controller)
- 2026-02-20T07:43:00Z: Token guard recovered (day budget, 5h window, and context all healthy). Project state auto-resumed to `active` and execution will continue from the latest checkpoint using the queued next task.

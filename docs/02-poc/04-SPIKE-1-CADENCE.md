# Spike #1 Cadence

Window: current POC batch  
Owner: PM

## Checkpoint rhythm
- Daily async checkpoint (AM): scope, blockers, ownership.
- Mid-window sync: architecture/perf validation against budgets.
- End-window review: acceptance checklist + go/no-go recommendation.

## Checkpoint outputs
1. Status delta since last checkpoint
2. Risk updates (new/cleared)
3. Evidence additions (demo/perf/qa/defects)
4. Next 24h priorities

## Escalation triggers
- Critical-path item blocked > 4 hours
- Core-flow critical defect discovered
- Performance budget miss > 20% on interaction or generation targets

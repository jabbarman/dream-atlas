# Spike #1 Acceptance Checklist

Phase: POC  
Owner: PM  
Status: Draft-for-execution

## Required proofs
- [ ] 20–100 sample fragments can generate a stable 2D layout.
- [ ] Map supports pan/zoom/select with acceptable responsiveness.
- [ ] At least 2 meaningful clustering modes are available and explainable.
- [ ] Atlas state + metadata can be saved/loaded locally.
- [ ] Feasibility report produced with bottlenecks + go/no-go recommendation.

## Quality gates
- [ ] No open critical defects in core flow.
- [ ] Deterministic seed behavior validated (same seed => same layout).
- [ ] QA matrix executed for happy path + edge cases.
- [ ] Demo capture available (video/gif).
- [ ] PM + Tech Lead + QA sign-off recorded.

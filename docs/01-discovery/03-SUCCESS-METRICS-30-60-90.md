# Discovery — Success Metrics (30 / 60 / 90)

## North-star direction
Increase reflective/creative insight per exploration session.

## Guardrails
- Reliability: no critical crashes in core flow
- Ethics: no clinical positioning in UX/copy
- Privacy: user data ownership/private-by-default posture maintained

## 30 days — Foundation
### Delivery outcomes
- Text fragment input working
- Procedural 2D atlas generated
- Pan/zoom + node drill-in interaction working

### Measurable checks
- 1–2 internal users can complete capture + explore flow
- Atlas generation time within agreed budget (set baseline target during spike)
- Zero critical defects in core path

## 60 days — Meaningful use
### Delivery outcomes
- Basic clustering/grouping
- Save/load multiple atlases
- Search/highlight related memories + basic filtering

### Measurable checks
- Exploration sessions regularly exceed 10 minutes
- At least 3 distinct map patterns observed on real user data
- Users report discovered connections they had not previously seen

## 90 days — Compelling prototype
### Delivery outcomes
- Advanced procedural pass (terrain/biome/layer concept)
- Import/export capabilities
- Guided tour/memory path mode
- Shareable screenshots/map views

### Measurable checks
- Repeat usage by test users
- Strong qualitative demo signal: "changes how I see my memories/notes"
- Demo package ready for showcase/pitch

# Discovery — JTBD & User Segments (v1)

## Jobs To Be Done

### JTBD-1 (Creatives)
**When** I have a growing set of notes, fragments, and images for ideas,  
**I want to** navigate them spatially and by thematic proximity,  
**so I can** discover new narrative/creative directions quickly.

### JTBD-2 (Reflective users)
**When** I log dreams/memories over weeks or months,  
**I want to** revisit patterns and clusters in an intuitive map,  
**so I can** notice recurring themes and reflect with more depth.

### JTBD-3 (Exploratory users)
**When** I experiment with personal data interfaces,  
**I want to** see emergent structure from simple inputs,  
**so I can** learn from and enjoy the exploration process.

## Segment priorities (Discovery)
1. **Primary launch segment:** Creatives with existing text fragments
2. **Secondary validation segment:** Reflective users with regular journaling habit
3. **Deferred segment:** Educators/researchers (after MVP evidence)

## Early evidence signals to collect
- Users report at least one non-obvious connection found during exploration
- Users complete "capture → map → revisit" loop without guidance
- Users can explain what map regions/constellations mean in their own words

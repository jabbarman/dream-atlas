# Discovery — Problem Framing (v1)

## Core problem
People capture dream/memory/idea fragments but can rarely *explore* them meaningfully over time. Existing tools are mostly linear, so emotional and relational patterns stay hidden.

## Why now
- Consumer familiarity with generative experiences is rising.
- Personal knowledge tools remain list/document-centric.
- There is whitespace for a reflective, creative interface that is exploratory without making clinical claims.

## Who is affected first
### Primary users
1. **Creatives** (writers, artists, game designers, filmmakers)
2. **Reflective users** (journaling, dream logging, self-reflection)

### Secondary users
- Educators/researchers exploring narrative and qualitative material
- Exploratory tech users interested in procedural systems

## Current alternatives and gaps
- Notes apps/journals: easy capture, poor relational discoverability
- Mind maps: relational but often manual/structured, not emergent
- Creative tools: strong visuals but not tied to personal memory exploration

## Product thesis
If memory fragments are mapped into a navigable procedural atlas with clear and legible visual metaphors, users will discover unexpected connections and gain higher reflective/creative value than from linear review.

## Non-claims / boundaries
- Not a therapy/diagnosis tool
- No implicit mental health outcomes promised
- Exploratory and creative framing only

# Dream Atlas — Concept Intake (Initial)

Date: 2026-02-19
Source: `docs/PROJECT.txt`

## Problem
People capture dream/memory/idea fragments, but current tools are linear and poor at spatial/relational discovery.

## Target users
- Primary: creatives; reflective users
- Secondary: educators/researchers; curious exploratory tech users

## Value proposition
Transform fragmentary personal text into a navigable, procedural atlas that reveals patterns and meaning over time.

## Delivery goal
- 30 days: navigable 2D atlas prototype from text
- 60 days: meaningful clustering/search/filtering and evidence of discovery value
- 90 days: compelling demo-ready prototype with guided exploration and shareability

## Scope boundaries (v1)
In: web app, 2D navigation, node/region metaphors, basic clustering, simple storage
Out: native mobile, real-time collaboration, heavy social, clinical claims, 3D worlds, heavy AI psychology interpretation

## Constraints
- Part-time project, 8–12 week prototype target
- Minimal budget
- Sensitive user data; private-by-default posture

## Top risks
- Map looks pretty but not meaningful
- Procedural complexity time sink
- Scope creep (3D/social/heavy AI)
- Users infer therapy positioning
- Data model rigidity

## Decision owner
User (Product Owner / Creative Director)

# Discovery — Prioritized Opportunity Backlog (v1)

Scoring: 1 (low) to 5 (high)

| ID | Opportunity | User Value | Feasibility | Risk Reduction | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|------------|-------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| OPP-01 | Core map generation from text fragments | 5 | 4 | 5 | P0 | Must prove value proposition quickly |
| OPP-02 | Legible visual metaphor system (nodes/regions/constellations) | 5 | 4 | 4 | P0 | Avoid “pretty but meaningless” failure |
| OPP-03 | Pan/zoom + node details interaction | 5 | 5 | 3 | P0 | Core usability baseline |
| OPP-04 | Basic clustering/tag proximity model | 4 | 3 | 5 | P0 | Tests meaningfulness of structure |
| OPP-05 | Search/highlight related memory | 4 | 4 | 3 | P1 | Supports discovery loop |
| OPP-06 | Save/load atlas states | 4 | 4 | 3 | P1 | Needed for longitudinal use |
| OPP-07 | Guided memory path mode | 4 | 3 | 3 | P1 | High demo value, defer if schedule tight |
| OPP-08 | Import/export pack | 3 | 4 | 2 | P2 | Useful for portability and demoing |
| OPP-09 | Advanced procedural layers/biomes | 3 | 2 | 2 | P2 | Strong scope-creep risk |
| OPP-10 | Optional AI-assisted labels | 3 | 2 | 2 | P3 | Keep lightweight; defer unless needed |

## Initial execution order
1. OPP-01 → OPP-02 → OPP-03 (core loop)
2. OPP-04 (meaningfulness proof)
3. OPP-05 + OPP-06 (retention utility)
4. OPP-07/08/09/10 according to time and risk

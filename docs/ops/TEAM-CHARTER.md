# Team Charter (Dream Atlas)

## Mission
Deliver Dream Atlas from concept to MVP with strong product discovery, deliberate technical de-risking, and release quality discipline.

## Team roster (stable)
- **Delivery Lead / PM** — roadmap, scope, risk, cadence, stakeholder alignment
- **Product Discovery Lead** — problem framing, users/JTBD, outcomes, priorities
- **UX/UI Design Lead** — journeys, wireframes, interaction & component specs
- **Tech Lead / Architect** — architecture, NFRs, technical spikes, standards
- **Development Stream** — implementation across frontend/backend/integration work
- **QA Lead** — test strategy, acceptance verification, regression and release sign-off

## Working agreement
- **Artifact-first:** all decisions live in repository docs; chat is not source-of-truth.
- **Single ownership per artifact:** exactly one accountable role per doc.
- **Definition of Ready (DoR):** item must include business goal, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and test approach.
- **Definition of Done (DoD):** code + tests + docs + review + QA acceptance.
- **Decision protocol:** major choices recorded as ADRs before implementation.
- **Risk protocol:** maintain an active risk register with owner + mitigation date.

## Ceremonies
- Planning: phase kickoff + sprint planning
- Daily async: blockers, next actions, risk updates
- Review/demo: end of iteration checkpoints
- Retrospective: what to keep, change, drop

## Escalation
1. Role lead attempts resolution
2. PM + Tech Lead triage
3. Scope/time tradeoff decision
4. Record outcome in ADR or risk register

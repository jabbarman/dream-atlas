# Permission Blocker Escalation Protocol

## Policy
If a permission/access blocker is anticipated or encountered, notify the Product Owner via WhatsApp with:
1. What blocker occurred
2. Why it blocks progress
3. Exact user action required to unblock

## WhatsApp format
"Dream Atlas blocker: <issue>. Needed from you: <steps>. Impact: <what is paused>."

## Tracking
- Record active blockers in `docs/status/PROJECT-STATE.yaml` under `permission_blockers`.
- Add sent blocker notifications to `docs/status/REPORT-LOG.md`.
